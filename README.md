# LEGOS-SLEEC: Tool for Formalizing and Analyzing Normative Requirements

## Purpose
We present *LEGOS-SLEEC*, a tool designed to support interdisciplinary stakeholders in specifying normative requirements as <em>SLEEC rules</em> ((social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural domain specific language(^1)), and in analyzing and debugging their well-formedness. *LEGOS-SLEEC* is built using four previously published components (TADA^2,TADA2^3,TADA3^4,TADA4^5), which have been shown to be effective and usable across nine case studies (^6). Reflecting on this experience, we have significantly improved the user interface of *LEGOS-SLEEC* and its diagnostic support, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements using four interdisciplinary stakeholders (^7).
