# LEGOS-SLEEC: Tool for Formalizing and Analyzing Normative Requirements

## Purpose
We present *LEGOS-SLEEC*, a tool designed to support interdisciplinary stakeholders in specifying normative requirements as <em>SLEEC rules</em> ((social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural domain specific language(^1)), and in analyzing and debugging their well-formedness. *LEGOS-SLEEC* is built using four previously published components (TADA^2,TADA2^3,TADA3^4,TADA4^5), which have been shown to be effective and usable across nine case studies (^6). Reflecting on this experience, we have significantly improved the user interface of *LEGOS-SLEEC* and its diagnostic support, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements using four interdisciplinary stakeholders (^7).

### Verifying Installation

To ensure the Sleec plugin is installed correctly:
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Create or open a project.
3. Navigate to **File > Settings > Plugins** (or **Preferences > Plugins** on macOS) and confirm that `Sleec` appears in the **Installed** tab.

If the plugin is installed successfully, you should see Sleec-specific features (e.g., syntax highlighting, code completion, or tool windows) in your IDE when opening a .sleec file.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Verify that your IntelliJ IDEA version is compatible with the Sleec plugin.
- Ensure you restarted IntelliJ IDEA after installation.
- Check the plugin logs in **Help > Show Log in Explorer/Finder** for detailed error messages.
- Visit the plugin's [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Kevin-Kolyakov/sleec-intellij-plugin/issues) for community support.

# Usage

Below, we describe the steps to reproduce our evaluation. To do so, you will need to install the previous version of the tool to replicate our comparison using the four case studies available in [the case-study folder](case-studies/).

## Install and launch the previous tool 
1. Install the previous version of the tool by following the instructions here: https://github.com/NickF0211/LEGOs
2. Launch the previous tool: 
  ```
   python3 sleecFrontEnd.py
  ```
   sometimes you might need to use instead:
  ```
   python sleecFrontEnd.py
  ```
3. To verify that the previous tool is correctly installed, click on 
  ```
check redundancy
  ```
and ensure that it displays a diagnostic.

## Reproduce our experiments 

### Checking Situational Conflicts
1. Copy the `SAFESCADE.sleec` definitions and rules from [here](case-studies/SAFESCADE.sleec) to the previous tool IDE.
2. Check for situational conflicts by clicking on `check situational conflict`.
3. Install and launch our new tool LEGOS-SLEEC, following the instructions the [installation instructions](#Installation_Instructions).
4. Click on the situational conflict logo as shown below:  
   ![Situational Conflict Button](/img/s-logo.png "Check situational conflict")
5. You can now compare the diagnostics generated by the two versions of the tool. Refer to the image below to see the expected outcomes:  
   ![Situational Conflict Comparison](/img/s-conflict-comparison.png "Compare the situational conflict diagnostics generated by our tool with those produced by the previous version.")  
   Note that the previous version of the tool displayed all possible conflicts at once, which was overwhelming for stakeholders. In contrast, the new version displays one conflict at a time. Once the first conflict is resolved, the next one is shown.  
6. To resolve the first issue, modify the rules by following these steps: X. Then, check again to ensure the conflict is resolved. Stakeholders can continue this process iteratively until no situational conflicting rules remain.
